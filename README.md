Hello all. I started programming in university and to my surprise did not find it to be as soul crushing as it thought
it would be and admittedly even find it fun at times. I currently work as a systems engineer at a startup company in
Melbourne Australia so if you are in the area and want to chat or something I would be keen.

I have a wide range of coding projects from rigorous algorithms and data structures to full stack development. I also have
some exposure to machine learning and AI. My personal projects are listed below. Although not all of the code is on GitHub.

Travel App - React Native

Cosmetic Product Formulation MacOS app - Python (PyQt for UI, bundled via PyInstaller)

Checkers variation AI - Python

Gender Wage Gap Analysis - Python (Jupyter Notebook), Machine Learning

Frogger Game - Java

Rudimentary Spell Check - C

Prosthetic Hand control algorithm (partial) - C++ (Arduino)

Bluetooth controlled Robot - C++ (Arduino)

PID ElectroMagnetic control loop - C++ (Arduino)
